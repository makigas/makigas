require 'json'

# This class is used to import bulk videos and playlists into the system.
#
# Old makigas website is based on WordPress, which uses a different schema
# for storing data. This class doesn't import WordPress export files. An export
# file must be separately processed into a migration scheme that is compatible
# with this format.
#
# The data migrator will accept a JSON file containing information for videos.
# The schema is based on a root that is an array of JSON objects for topics.
# Each topic is a JSON object that has many fields shared with the Topic model
# in this webapp: title, description, created_at and playlists.
#
# Playlists is an array of JSON objects that represent a playlist, again
# sharing many fields with the Playlist model: title, description, youtube_id,
# created_at and videos.
#
# Videos is another array of JSON objects that represents a video and uses
# the same fields as the Video model: title, description, youtube_id,
# natural_duration, position and created_at.
#
# There should be also a folder with thumbnails for YouTube videos. Each file
# should have the name "#{v}.jpg" where v is the YouTube ID for a video.
# The migrator will paste the thumbnail file as the photo for the video.
# The migrator will paste the first video photo as the photo for the playlist.
# The migrator will paste the first playlist photo as the photo for the topic.
